A MATLAB library of ODE solvers.

## Usage
***Final usage instructions to be determined -- one function where the
user specifies the method in addition to the input parameters?***

Four solvers are included in this package: the explicit Euler method; the
implicit Euler method; the Predictor-Corrector method; and the second-order
Runge-Kutta method.

Each solver is implemented in two parts. One part of each solver advances the
solution by one time step, giving as output the next value in the solution
sequence. The second part iterates this procedure *N* times, where *N* is the
total number of iterations and is specified by the user.

## Conclusion
